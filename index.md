# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about Random stuff like starwars, 3d printing and more. <br>
Frist lets talk about the RZ-1 A-wing Light interceptor.<br>
it's top speed is 120 MGLT, (MeGaLighT per hour). it's sheilding over board, and it's wedge shape desin gives it a super strong hull. It was so hard to handel that it's buble canopy was needed to be able to react to object. The helmet worn by A-wing piots was also desinged to give execlent visibility.
