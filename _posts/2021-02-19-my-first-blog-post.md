Frist lets talk about the RZ-1 A-wing Light interceptor.
it’s top speed is 120 MGLT, (MeGaLighT per hour)
it’s sheilding is over board, 
and it’s wedge shape desin gives it a super strong hull. 
It was so hard to handel that it’s buble canopy was needed to be able to react to objects in space.
The helmet worn by A-wing piots was also desinged to give execlent visibility.
It's cost was lager 175,000 credits but it was worth it. 
It made an amazing battering ram due to it's feultanks being in the front but it would still hold together if it ramed most ships.
When one A-wing took out a super star destroyer by ramming it it was very much worth it.
The reason it is called the A-wing ,in univers, is beacause it looks like one wing in the shape of an A.
Out of univers, it's beacause the producers of RoTJ made to ships for the movie, Ship A (the A-wing) and ship B (the B-wing).
it was manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards and was the best interceptor of it's time, but even against the Frist Order it could hold it's own.
